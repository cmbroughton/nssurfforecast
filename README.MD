# NS Waves Worker

This Python project contains a simple hourly surf forecast worker for three Halifax‚Äêarea surf spots: **Lawrencetown Beach**, **Martinique Beach**, and **Silversands (Cow Bay)**.  

It is designed to run as a scheduled task (for example with cron or a GitHub Action) and to write predicted surf quality and stoke values back to your Supabase database.
